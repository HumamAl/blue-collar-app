Hi,

TaskRabbit for plumbers, electricians, and movers — the two-sided matching and trust layer is what makes or breaks it, and I built a working version before reaching out: {VERCEL_URL}

The demo covers trade listings, booking flow, and separate homeowner/tradesperson views — simple and clean, the way you described. Built Lynt Marketplace with full vendor onboarding, listing management, and transaction tracking ready for production.

Should trade verification (license, insurance) be self-reported or does the platform enforce it before a tradesperson goes live?

10-minute call or I can send a written scope — your pick.

P.S. Happy to record a quick 60-second walkthrough of the demo if that's easier than clicking around.
